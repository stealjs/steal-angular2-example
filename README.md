1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open in your browser.

> Note: this example includes Angular's supported browser refresh utility, which is pretty fast.  It does not, yet, use StealJS's live-reload, which does hot module swapping (no browser refresh).

> Pro Tip: If you keep your templates in a separate .js file and use a code highlighting schema for "HTML (Mustache)", you get great syntax highlighting.  Open the app/app.component.js and its template for an example.
